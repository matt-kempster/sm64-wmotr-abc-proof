description: Checklist for proof work in this repo. Use before committing Rocq/Coq changes, and before adding a Definition/Lemma/Hypothesis to the spine. Progress means the capstone says more about the REAL SM64 program; a green build, axiom-cleanliness or a new disconnected lemma is not progress. Covers the audit script, the tethering test, phantom-forall rows, and statement fidelity.

# Proof discipline

## The one question

> Is the capstone now closer to a **true** statement about the **real** SM64
> program than it was before?

Green builds, axiom-cleanliness and new true lemmas are the floor. They are not the
goal. The failure this skill exists for is a session of clean, `Qed`'d work that is
disconnected from the real theorem: lemmas about placeholders, or a definition that
doesn't mean what its name says. This happened here once: four green, axiom-clean commits,
all in `Unwired/`, and the theorem moved nowhere. See
[*Did you prove what you think you proved?*](https://leanprover-community.github.io/did_you_prove_it.html).

## Where the bottom line is (keep this current)

- **GOAL 1** (no-A ⇒ no-fly): `NoAImpliesNoFly/NoAImpliesNoFlyTwelve.v`,
  `noA_no_spawn_never_flying_linked12`. The step is one real `execute_mario_action` over
  any link of the 12 TUs. The open surface is its `Hypothesis` rows (~35 external-call
  and boundary rows; see `docs/TRUST.md` §4).
- **GOAL 2** (WMotR needs A): `WMotRRequiresA/HeightFrame.v`,
  `wmotr_noA_height_bound_linked12`. This is a conditional theorem over ONE WMotR
  visit (frames end with `in_wmotr`), under input with A neither pressed nor held
  (`a_used_real`). Φ is concrete
  (`HeightInvariant.v`), `Hphi_y` is proved (YMAX = 2796), the level-data rows are proved (`WMotRLevel.v`), and the crux is the lemma
  `seg_action_phi`, whose move arithmetic is proved (`HeightMoveCatalog.chain_keeps_budget`). Open rows:
  - `Hframe_stays_noA`
  - `Hframe_keeps_world`: the run carries `PhiW` = Φ ∧ `WMotRWorld.wmotr_world` (surfaces of
    WMotR's types, nothing held or ridden, no quicksand). Without W the other rows are false
    over phantom worlds; grow W, don't drop it
  - `Hframe_is_move_chain`, the value walk. It is false if an unmodelled move fires, so check the
    `Step` constructors against any new y/vel writer.
  - (`wmotr_gap` and `wmotr_poles` are now proved from generated level data, `WMotRLevel.v`)
  - the flank specs (TRUST 0.7)

  The coin link is also open.
- `docs/TRUST.md` is the ledger of everything a reader must believe. Read
  `Print Assumptions` (`pipeline/assumptions.sh`) together with the Hypothesis rows:
  holes appear as axioms, but assumptions appear as rows.

## What counts as progress

1. **Eliminate a row.** Prove it for the real program.
2. **Refine a row** into sharper real pieces that can each be discharged, even if the
   count goes up. This counts only if the new rows:
   - are about real program objects (named functions, fields and offsets from
     `generated/`);
   - are strictly more precise than what they replaced;
   - have a credible discharge path;
   - are consumed on the spine.

   Decompose the gap; never collapse it. A row that restates the conclusion is laundering.
3. **Partial work aimed at 1 or 2, on the spine.** Half a closure on the spine beats a
   finished lemma in `Unwired/`.
4. **Finding that a row, number or design claim is false.** This is progress too, and
   often the most valuable kind. Examples: E3's Δ_pot, the VIRTUAL_TO_PHYSICAL UB frames,
   the flank ∀-rows.

`Unwired/` work isn't done until it is promoted: `git mv` it onto the spine and have a
spine file use it. Otherwise say plainly that nothing consumes it yet. CI's firewall
forbids the spine from importing `Unwired/`.

## We don't need `forall`: SM64 is one specific codebase

One program, one call graph, one set of externals. A row that quantifies over every
`le` / `fd` / `ef` / memory can admit states the game never produces. Then a true fact
becomes a false row. It happened repeatedly:

- `forall le m` in a per-`Sassign` check, where a temp was allowed to alias Mario's block
  although the program had just loaded it from `marioObj`;
- the GOAL-2 flank rows, "spec ⇒ MWF m ⇒ MWF m'" over every m' matching loose y/action
  clauses;
- "y ≤ YMAX is preserved by a frame": false, since upward velocity is unconstrained;
- the crux row with a Φ that lacks an action whitelist, which would range over mem_ok
  memories in A-gated actions.

The fix is always the same: reason about the actual execution, or enumerate the actual
finite set. If a row looks true but won't go through, first ask whether it ranges over
states the program never reaches. Also ask whether each premise is satisfiable: an
unsatisfiable oracle premise makes everything above it vacuous (the P1′ lesson).

## PIPELINE, not bespoke

Every fact about SM64 comes from the clightgen'd AST in `generated/`. Pin constants and
offsets there with `vm_compute` (e.g. `mario_pos_offset_concrete`), and never transcribe
them by hand. Numbers the proof depends on (budgets, level data) come from tools that read
the vendor source, such as `tools/goal2_ladder.py` and `tools/goal2_budget.py`, not from
prose. Check prose against code before building on it.

## The audit (the floor)

```bash
bash .claude/skills/proof-discipline/discipline_check.sh
```

It runs the build, checks for holes, checks each capstone's axiom footprint, and runs the
firewall/orphan check. It also prints the residual surface. Run it before committing proof
changes. To audit a specific capstone:
`discipline_check.sh SM64.Proofs.<Path>.<Module> <theorem> ...`.
Always build via `pipeline/*.sh`, never bare `coqc`: a bare `coqc` can report a false green.

## Before claiming progress, answer

- **What got more real?** Name the placeholder that became a generated-AST object, or the
  row that was discharged or sharpened.
- **New assumption?** Is it a refinement or a laundering? Update `docs/TRUST.md` in the
  same commit.
- **Spine or island?**
- **Statement fidelity:** do `step`, `mem_ok`, `Phi` and `y_le` still mean what their
  names claim?
- **Non-vacuity:** are the rows jointly satisfiable? Does a positive control or real-game
  tether (`experiments/oracle`) exercise them?
